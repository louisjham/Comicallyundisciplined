dismissed from the very start after I explained what the situation was. And as the conversation
continued I could tell that the operator sounded very much put out with the whole interaction
after finding out that my complaint concerned my neighbor who has mental issue and frequently
calls the police. It"s understandable that the police has dealt with my neighbors several times but
that shouldn"t have anything to do with me giving them a call. I believe my call should have been
handled with more finesse and professionalism. My neighbor has just kicked in my door at close
to 6am in the morning waking me out of my sleep. And I was feeling fearful and confused and
instead of being treated like someone who needed compassion, I was instead treated as if I was
more of a nuance. This situation wasn"t handled with the seriousness that was needed. Because
the operator judged my call based on my neighbors previous actions I was pushed down on the
list as a lower priority which is unacceptable. The situation it self showed that he was escalating,
as well as showed that someone else life was at stake because of his actions. The fact that the
situation wasn"t taken serious is really devastating to me b/c this situation could have gone a
completely different way and it was not treated with the necessary correct steps that needed to
be done. Also I"m not sure why he wasn"t taken to a mental behavior center instead of the
hospital and was released shortly after. The case number is
- I really hope someone
reads this and actually follows up on this.`,

Re: Report # GO - 2025-2751517
Internal Affairs / Office Of Police Oversight
Hello, this is
I am filing a formal complaint regarding misconduct by APD officers
on October 2, 2024 at
I was wrongfully detained, placed in
excessively tight handcuffs, publicly humiliated, and treated as a criminal without any probable
cause or questions asked.
Officers were on private property without permission. I was there lawfully, working security at
the request of my employer, and this location is also my lawful residence due to my housing
situation under the Violence Against Women Act protections.
My dogs were traumatized, impounded, injured, and microchipped without my consent, despite
my clear verbal and written objections. Items were seized, my vehicle was impounded, and I was
denied access to my phone and contacts.
The officers' actions caused:
Emotional trauma
Loss of income
Damage to my reputation as a Texas teacher
Financial hardship
Harm to my property and animals
The District Attorney dismissed and rejected the charges on October 30, 2024. Because this
matter is fully resolved and dismissed, I am formally requesting the immediate release and return
of all property taken from me, including:
My BB gun
My Smith & Wesson SD40VE .40 caliber handgun,
serial number HEP5962, along with
all magazines and ammunition seized
Any other items removed from my vehicle or person
I am requesting that these items be returned today, as there is no legal basis for them to continue
being held.
Clarification of My Legal Rights Under Texas Law
Under Texas law, and per well-established firearms statutes, an individual who has not been on
probation or under supervision for over five years has their firearm rights restored, including the
right to possess a firearm in their home or residence.
I have not been on any probation or supervision for over three decades.
This means:
1. My firearm rights were fully restored long ago.
2. My vehicle and the private property where I live constitute my home under Texas law.
3. I was legally allowed to possess both my BB gun and my personal firearm.
I have written documentation from both the property owner and property manager, confirming
that:
I am legally permitted to live on the property
I am legally permitted to work security on the property
I am legally residing there as my home
I assist with safety and help maintain peace on the premises
This makes my possession of a firearm fully lawful and protected by statute.
Background and Wrongful Detention
As stated previously, I was wrongfully detained on October 2nd.
Officers:
Entered private property without permission
Never asked questions or attempted communication
Immediately escalated the situation
Used excessively tight handcuffs
Prevented me from retrieving my phone from my vehicle
Impounded both my truck and my dogs
Microchipped my dogs against my explicit objection
Traumatized my animals
Forced me to pay nearly $500 to retrieve my vehicle
Forced me to pay over $230 to recover my dogs "unaltered," although they were still
microchipped
Embarrassed me in public and defamed my character
This incident was triggered by a case from over three decades ago, a case I did not commit and
one that I am currently pursuing relief on, similar to the Michael Morton wrongful conviction
situation. This decades-old injustice continues to affect my rights and how I was treated on
October 2nd.
Case Status
Again, the District Attorney dismissed the case on October 30, 2024.
There is no legal reason for my firearm or property to remain in custody.
I reserve all legal rights, including:
The right to seek counsel
The right to file for damages
The right to pursue civil action
The right to file complaints regarding conduct and policy violations
Request for Immediate Release of Property
I am requesting immediate confirmation of:
1.
Where I can pick up my firearm, magazines, ammunition, and BB gun
2.
When I can pick them up
3.
Assurance that all items, including the Smith & Wesson SD40VE (.40 cal), serial number
HEP5962, and my magazines with rounds, will be returned without delay

were provided), and that neither of the two employees involved had returned his calls. He further
stated that he will be leaving the department in January and that the case will likely be
suspended.
Given the approximate value of the missing items, this matter clearly falls under grand theft, and I
am concerned about the lack of urgency. Specifically, I need clarity on whether the following
actions have been taken:
Has the detective personally visited local pawn shops?
Has he attempted to visit the residence of the former employee involved?
Has he contacted me to arrange a meeting with the current employee still on staff?
Has he had a thorough conversation with

misplacement?
Has he obtained proof of ownership from the customer?
Has he provided reasonable updates or explanations to either

understand that I cannot proceed with filing an insurance claim without documentation of a
reasonable APD investigation, as our insurer will require supporting evidence and a "proof of
loss" that includes APD findings.

    originalText: `To Whom It May Concern:
My name is
. My date of birth is
. I am a resident
of Austin. I am writing to file a complaint against an officer of the Austin Police Department (APD).
I had an encounter with an APD officer on (Monday) December 2, 2025. This incident took
place at approximately 9:30 AM in the parking lot of the H-E-B located at 7010 West Highway 71,
Austin, TX 78735. The officer"s vehicle number was "UT-13".
The purpose of this complaint is to highlight what I perceive as discourteous and unprofessional
conduct by the officer, which resulted in a distressing and unnecessary confrontation.
Description of Incident:
On December 2, 2025, at approximately 9:30 AM, I was parked in the H-E-B parking lot at 7010
West Highway 71. I was in the passenger seat of my vehicle, awaiting my spouse to return from
the grocery store. At this time, I observed an APD officer (in vehicle UT-13) speaking with an
individual who appeared to be experiencing homelessness. The officer seemed to be issuing the
individual a citation.
A few moments later, the officer abruptly approached my vehicle. Without any prior interaction or
warning, he stated, "You can"t be parked here." I was surprised by the officer"s tone and lack of
explanation. I promptly responded that I was merely waiting for my spouse and would be
departing shortly.
The officer then escalated the situation by aggressively demanding, "Where are your papers?" I
was taken aback by this confrontational approach, especially since I was not driving and had
committed no apparent infraction. I calmly explained that I was not the driver of the vehicle and
therefore did not possess the vehicle"s registration or my driver"s license. My spouse, who was the
driver, had both documents with him inside the store.
Upon reviewing the documents, the officer's tone completely changed. He became noticeably
calmer and handed the documents back to my spouse without further incident. No citation was
issued, and the officer departed.
Concerns and Request for Action:
I find the officer's initial conduct to be highly unprofessional and discourteous. His aggressive
approach, unfounded accusations, and escalating tone caused me significant distress and
embarrassment in a public setting. It is my belief that the officer failed to:
1. Demonstrate professionalism and respect: The officer's tone and language were
unwarranted and lacked basic courtesy.
2. Adhere to proper procedure: Approaching a parked vehicle and immediately demanding
"papers" from a passenger, without any probable cause or explanation, seems to be a
deviation from standard police protocol.
3. De-escalate the situation: Instead of attempting to understand my explanation, the officer
chose to become confrontational and accusatory.
I respectfully request that this complaint be investigated thoroughly. I believe the officer in
question should receive additional training in de-escalation techniques, professional conduct,
and appropriate interaction with the public. I understand the challenges faced by law enforcement
officers, but this incident left me feeling targeted and mistreated without justification.
Thank you for your time and consideration of this serious matter. I look forward to a prompt and fair
resolution.`,

    allegation: "Improper Police Procedure",

    originalText: `On Monday, Dec. 2nd, around 11:30 AM, I witnessed a very unsettling traffic incident involving
Austin Police Officer King (badge 8054, vehicle 7531).
Location: Northbound N. Mopac Expy, approaching the Research Blvd. exit.
Details: Officer King was driving a black SUV (unit 7531) in the middle lane. The incident began
when a small, dark-colored sedan (possibly a Honda Civic, with a distinct loud exhaust) in the far
left lane passed Officer King at what appeared to be a high rate of speed.
Immediately after the sedan passed him, Officer King rapidly accelerated, weaving through traffic
from the middle lane to the far left lane. He did so without activating his emergency lights or siren.
He continued to pursue the sedan at an extremely high speed, disappearing around the bend near
Research Blvd.
My primary concern is the dangerous and potentially reckless manner in which Officer King drove.
His rapid acceleration and aggressive lane changes, especially without the use of emergency
signals, created a significant safety hazard for other drivers on the road. This behavior appears to
violate standard police procedure for initiating a pursuit or traffic stop, which typically requires the
use of lights and sirens to alert other motorists.
I understand that police officers often need to respond quickly to situations, but this incident
appeared to be an unsignaled, high-speed chase that endangered the public.
I request a review of Officer King's conduct during this incident, including any dashcam or bodycam
footage that may exist, to ensure adherence to APD's pursuit policies and safe driving practices.

    allegation: "Improper Police Procedure",
    outcome: "Supervisory Referral",
    originalText: `My complaint is regarding the conduct of an APD officer during a recent traffic stop that I believe
was unjust and violated my rights.
On December 3, 2025, at approximately 10:45 PM, I was driving northbound on Lamar Blvd near
the intersection of 38th Street. I was in the left-hand lane, preparing to turn left onto 38th. As I
approached the intersection, an APD patrol vehicle (Unit 7027, driven by Officer
) suddenly veered into my lane from the right, almost causing a collision. I had to
swerve sharply to avoid hitting the officer's vehicle.
Despite almost causing an accident, the officer immediately activated his lights and pulled me
over. I found this incredibly unreasonable, as I was the one who had to take evasive action to
prevent a crash.
During the stop, the officer was aggressive and accusatory. He immediately demanded my license
and registration, stating, "Do you know why I pulled you over? You almost hit my vehicle!" I tried
to explain that he had cut me off, but he cut me short, saying, "Don't argue with me. Just give me
your documents."
He then proceeded to issue me a citation for "unsafe lane change" (Citation #T-).
I strongly dispute this citation. I did not make an unsafe lane change; I was in my lane when the
officer merged into it without warning. His actions were reckless, and then he unfairly blamed me
for his own dangerous driving.
I request a thorough investigation into this incident. I believe the officer's actions constitute:
1. Unsafe Driving by an APD Officer: The officer initiated an unsafe lane change that nearly
caused a collision.
2. Improper Police Procedure: The officer pulled me over and cited me for an action that he
himself caused, seemingly to cover up his own error.
3. Discourtesy/Lack of Professionalism: The officer was aggressive and dismissive of my
attempt to explain the situation.
I would like to request any dashcam or bodycam footage from this incident. I believe it will
corroborate my account and demonstrate the officer's improper conduct.
Thank you for your attention to this serious matter. I look forward to a prompt and fair
resolution.`,

approximately 1:00 PM, at the H-E-B located at 1000 E 41st St, Austin, TX 78751.
While shopping, I observed an APD patrol vehicle (Unit 7055) parked illegally in a designated
handicap parking space. The vehicle did not display a handicap placard, nor did it appear to be
responding to an emergency, as there were no activated emergency lights or sirens, and the officer
was not actively engaged in any urgent police business.
I found this particularly egregious as there were other available non-handicap parking spaces in
the vicinity. The officer appeared to be simply running an errand or taking a break.
This incident is concerning because it demonstrates a blatant disregard for traffic laws and the
rights of individuals with disabilities by a law enforcement officer. It sets a poor example for the
community and undermines public trust when those sworn to uphold the law are seen
disregarding it themselves.
I took a photograph of the vehicle and its location, which I am prepared to provide if requested.
I request that this matter be investigated and that the officer involved be reminded of the importance
of adhering to parking regulations, especially those designed to assist vulnerable members of our
community.

    allegation: "Discourtesy or Improper Conduct",
    outcome: "Community Concern",
    originalText: `I am writing to file a complaint regarding an incident that occurred on December 14, 2025, at
approximately 7:00 PM, at a local restaurant.
I witnessed an APD officer (Unit 9050) accepting free food and drinks from the restaurant staff.
This appears to be a clear violation of ethical conduct and a form of gratuity. It creates a perception
of favoritism and compromises the integrity of the police department.
I request that this matter be investigated and that the officer involved be disciplined for their
misconduct.
Thank you for your attention to this complaint.`,
